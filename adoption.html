            <h3>When can I let my cat out for the first time?</h3>
            <p>It's important that your new cat is given at least 2-3 weeks to adjust to their new home. Without this time,
                your new cat may not have had enough time to settle and often get lost trying to find a familiar area.</p>

                <h3>Is it okay to get a second cat?</h3>
                <p>When deciding to get a new cat there are a variety of factors to consider. For example, cats are solitary and
                    territorial animals so it takes a while for them to accept and feel comfortable with changes and adult cats
                    tend to accpet kittens easier than adult cats. </p>
